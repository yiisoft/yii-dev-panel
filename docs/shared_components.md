# How to work with remote components

## About

Remote components are components that are located in a remote repository. 
They are not installed in the project, but are used as if they were provided from the backend. 
This allows feature allows you to create custom panels for the `yii-dev-panel` and render them as native components.

### How to test

First of all, you need to serve the `yii-dev-panel`.

Open a terminal and run:
```sh
cd packages/yii-dev-panel; npm start
```
It serves the yii-dev-panel project on `127.0.0.1:3000`. 

Then you need to serve your own built remote components. As an example you may use `examples/remote-panel` project.
Open a new terminal and run:
```sh
cd examples/remote-panel; npm run serve:dev
```
It serves an example project on `127.0.0.1:3002`.

Then open the file `packages/yii-dev-panel-sdk/src/Pages/Layout.tsx` and apply the following changes:
```diff
    {name: 'Open API', link: '/open-api'},
    // Uncomment to debug shared components
-    // {name: 'Shared', link: '/shared'},
+    {name: 'Shared', link: '/shared'},
```

Now you can open `http://localhost:3000/shared` and see the remote component in action.
