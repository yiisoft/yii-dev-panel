Connect the apps and serve the built app any way you want: nginx, apache, node, php built-in server.

### PWA (Progressive Web Application)

Online-mode or as standalone application.

Open https://yiisoft.github.io/yii-dev-panel

2. Standalone app
    1. Click "Install" button in the URL to install PWA application
    2. Run the application from the Applications
    3. Make sure your API works by clicking on "check mark"
    4. Use Yii dev panel
